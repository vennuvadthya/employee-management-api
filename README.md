# Employee Management API 

A simple Employee Management API built with **FastAPI** and **MongoDB**.
It demonstrates CRUD operations, querying, and aggregation with clean JSON responses and API documentation via Swagger UI.

---

##  Features

* **CRUD APIs** – Create, Get, Update, Delete employees
* **Querying & Aggregation**

  * List employees by department (sorted by joining date)
  * Average salary by department (MongoDB aggregation)
  * Search employees by skill
* **Health Check API** – Verify database connection
* **CORS support** – Allow cross-origin requests
* **Interactive Docs** – Swagger UI available at `/docs`

---

## Tech Stack

* **FastAPI** (Python web framework)
* **MongoDB** (NoSQL database)
* **Motor** (async MongoDB driver)
* **Uvicorn** (ASGI server)

* `GET /employees/{employee_id}` → Get employee by ID
* `PUT /employees/{employee_id}` → Update employee (partial updates supported)
* `DELETE /employees/{employee_id}` → Delete employee
* `GET /employees?department=Engineering` → List employees by department

### Aggregations & Search

* `GET /employees/avg-salary` → Average salary by department
* `GET /employees/search?skill=Python` → Search employees by skill

### Health Check

* `GET /health` → Check API and DB status

## Notes

* Duplicate employee IDs during test runs will return `400 – already exists` (expected behavior).
* Ensure MongoDB is running locally on `mongodb://localhost:27017`.
