# Employee Management API 

A simple Employee Management API built with **FastAPI** and **MongoDB**.
It demonstrates CRUD operations, querying, and aggregation with clean JSON responses and API documentation via Swagger UI.

  * Average salary by department (MongoDB aggregation)
  * Search employees by skill
* **Health Check API** â€“ Verify database connection
* **CORS support** â€“ Allow cross-origin requests
* **Interactive Docs** â€“ Swagger UI available at `/docs`

* **MongoDB** (NoSQL database)
* **Motor** (async MongoDB driver)
* **Uvicorn** (ASGI server)

##  Project Structure

```
employee-api-assignment/
â”‚â”€â”€ main.py              # FastAPI app with all endpoints
â”‚â”€â”€ test_api.py          # API testing script
â”‚â”€â”€ requirements.txt     # Dependencies
â”‚â”€â”€ README.md            # Project documentation
```

## Notes

* Duplicate employee IDs during test runs will return `400 â€“ already exists` (expected behavior).
* Ensure MongoDB is running locally on `mongodb://localhost:27017`.
